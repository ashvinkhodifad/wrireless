Installation notes
==================

For install on Mac Yosemite, special header file include paths are needed for
PyOpenSSL dependency source builds.  Install XCode and add explicit include path
for ffi package and generic include:

export CPATH=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/include/ffi:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/include/
